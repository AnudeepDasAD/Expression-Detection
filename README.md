# Expression-Detection
Going through the Cohn-Kanade facial expression dataset to assemble the training and testing data.
A flask app (emotion_detection_app.py) was also made, but since WSL in Python Anywhere does not support hardware access, it is unable to host
the app. 

Here are the results from the detection:
